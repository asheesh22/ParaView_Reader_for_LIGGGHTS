The Paraview Plugin can be used to display the dump-files directly in Paraview without converting them to VTK Format.

This advanced reader (see code in reader_src/text_reader/) can read any scalar or vectorial data (e.g., also that from fixes or computes).

Please see README File in the package for further information.
